# dotfiles
Different config files I use!

* *config.fish* - config for the [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
* *starship.toml* - config for the [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/)

## Acknowlegements
Special thanks to the awesome [Derek Taylor at DistroTube](https://gitlab.com/dwt1) for giving me the idea to track my dotfiles!
I'm currently using a modified version of his config.fish file while I'm transitioning shells.
